Remove preinstalled apps from your LG Flip Phone and add new apps



[The first version](https://github.com/biden2020prez/lgflip-kosher/releases/tag/v1.0.0) was released, with limited functionality.
It can remove Browser, FM Radio, e-mail, Text messaging, Hotspot, and Video from your phone.

For anyone curious, I just created two batch files with choices (using notepad), and used iexpress to put the batch files, plus ADB files into a single EXE file, which I put here to download.


Everyone, please put issues, questions, requests, and suggestions in the issues tab, and I'll try to help you the best I can.

[The Current Version](https://github.com/biden2020prez/lgflip-kosher/releases/tag/v1.0.1) has 38 apps available to install.
